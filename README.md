# Post Torrenting Automation

This is a group of scripts I wrote to work in conjuction with each other to automate my post downloading process.

post_transfer will send the file to another computer on my network and then detect whether the file was a video file or a music file or a rar file and then run the approriate sorting script from there.

for this to work you need mp3info, filebot, python, unrar, and the [python-plexapi](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi)
